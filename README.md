# House-Price-Prediction
in this project we worked with a house price train data set with 12 columns and 29451 rows and a test data set compsed of 11 columns and 68720 rows 
we made some cleaning work, then we visualize it 
after that we used the one hot encoding process and we calculate the mean absolute error it was high 
thus we utilized  the famous pipeline to calculate the predictionvalues of the test data set 
and we saved it in a csv file 
i hope you enjoy it ;)
